# PyImprove

提升Python编码能力的笔记。

The notebooks of improving my ability of Python language programming.

## Intro

I commited the notes directly in Chinese for convenience. I think if you are not a Chinese speaker, a translate software or ChatGPT could be used. Maybe I would translate them into English in the future. Maybe by using a translate software or LLM, too.

对笔记按类型进行了分类，每个文件的标题就是它的内容。

The notebooks have been classified by the content, and the title of each file figures out its content.

测试使用的Python版本是3.12。

Python 3.12 is used for testing.
