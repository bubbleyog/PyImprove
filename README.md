# PyImprove

提升Python编码能力的笔记。

The notebooks of improving my ability of Python language programming.

## Intro

First, I would appologize to the ones who are not Chinese speakers that I commited the notes directly in Chinese for convenience. I think you can use a translate software(or ChatGPT). Maybe I would translate them into English in the future. Maybe by using a translate software or LLM, too.

对笔记按类型进行了分类，每个文件的标题就是它的内容。

The notebooks have been classified by the content, and the title of each file figures out its content.

测试使用的Python版本是3.12。

Python 3.12 is used for testing.

## Thanks

较大一部分方法参考了indently.io_在Youtube上的视频，我提炼出其中的知识点，进行了整理和代码调试的工作，形成了可运行的代码。他的视频主要是挖掘Python中的一些特性和方法，值得推荐。

The larger part of the method in my notebooks references indently.io_'s video on Youtube, and I extracted the knowledge, organized and debugged, forming operable codes. His videos are mainly about some of the features and methods in Python that are recommended.
